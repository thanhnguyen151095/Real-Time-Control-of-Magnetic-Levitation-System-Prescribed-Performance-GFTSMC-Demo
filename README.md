In this video, we demonstrate a real-time experiment on a magnetic levitation (maglev) system using a **novel control approach** that handles **dynamic uncertainties** and **external disturbances** with high precision.

✅ The control strategy combines:
- **Prescribed Performance Control (PPC)**: Ensures that tracking errors stay within known, predefined boundaries.
- **Global Fast Terminal Sliding Mode Control (GFTSMC)**: Guarantees fast convergence to the target in finite time.
- **Modified Third-Order Sliding Mode Observer (MTOSMO)**: Accurately estimates total uncertainties and disturbances, significantly reducing chattering.

⚙️ Key Benefits:
- Finite-time convergence  
- Accurate position control  
- Reduced control chattering  
- Real-time implementation simplicity  
- Proven stability via Lyapunov analysis  

🧪 The system is tested through simulation and real-time experiments on a laboratory magnetic levitation platform, showing robust performance and excellent tracking capability.
